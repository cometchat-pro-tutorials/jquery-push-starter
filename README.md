## Running the demo
To run the demo follow these steps:

1. Head to the [CometChat dashboard](https://app.cometchat.com/) (you'll need to create a free account if you haven't already)
2. From the dashboard, create a new app called "jquery-push-app"
3. Once created, click the button **Explore**
4. Click **API Keys** on the left-hand-side and note the automatically-generated Full access API Key and the application ID as well
5. Go to the **Groups** tab and note the GUID of the group automatically created by CometChat
6. Download the repository [here](https://github.com/yemiwebby/jquery-push-starter/archive/master.zip) or by running `git clone https://github.com/yemiwebby/jquery-push-starter.git`

Next, open `js/scripts.js` and replace the placeholder below with your credentials as obtained from your CometChat dashboard:

```
window.COMETCHAT_APP_ID = 'YOUR_COMMETCHAT_APP_ID';
window.COMETCHAT_API_KEY = 'YOUR_COMMETCHAT_API_KEY';
```

7. Open the `index.html` file from any of your favorite browser to view the application.

8. Open the application in two separate windows and log in with any two of the test users: superhero1, superhero2, or superhero3

9. Once you are able to log in from both window, type a message and hit `Enter` on your keyboard to start a chat
